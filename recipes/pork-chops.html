  <h2>This super juicy grilled pork chops recipe packs a ton of delicious flavor and is perfectly cooked every time on the grill.</h2>
  
  <h3>Indgredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups honey</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>4 center-cut pork chops, 1/2-inch thick</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
     <h4>Step one</h4>
     <li>Mix lemon juice, honey, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and basil together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag; place pork chops in the bag,
       squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (overnight is best). Refrigerate the remaining marinade for basting.</li>
     <h4>Step two</h4>
     <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
     <h4>Step Three</h4>
     <li>Remove chops from the bag and discard the used marinade. Sprinkle chops with salt and black pepper.</li>
     <h4>Step Four</h4>
     <li>Grill chops on the preheated grill until browned and no longer pink inside, 20 to 25 minutes. Baste frequently with reserved marinade, being sure to let the mixture
       cook onto the chops. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
