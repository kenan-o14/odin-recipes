  <h2>Rich and bold flavors make this meal just right for Father's Day or any Sunday night dinner.</h2>
 
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul> 
   <li>1/2 Cup chopped fresh rosemary</li>
   <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
   <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
   <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>(1 1/2-pound) flank steak, trimmed excess fat</li>
   <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>
   <h3>Directions</h3>

  <ol>
    <h4>Step One</h4>
    <li>Combine 1/2 cup chopped fresh rosemary, garlic, 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, black pepper,
       1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender or food processor. Blend until
        smooth and set marinade aside.</li>
    <h4>Step Two</h4>
    <li>Pierce the steak with a fork 20 to 30 times. Place in a shallow baking dish. Pour marinade over steak
       and flip to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours. </li>
    <h4>Step Three</h4>
    <li>Combine 1/3 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon minced rosemary,
       1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt in a jar. Cover and shake the dressing to combine.
        Shake again before using.</li>
    <h4>Step Four</h4>    
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <h4>Step Five</h4>
    <li>Remove steak from marinade; scrape off any chunks of marinade. Discard used marinade.
       Season steak with salt and black pepper.</li>
    <h4>Step Six</h4>
    <li>Place steak on the preheated grill and cook until browned on the outside and red on the inside,
       about 6 to 8 minutes per side. Place 2 tablespoons of the olive oil-lemon juice dressing in a small bowl.
        Use rosemary sprig to baste the steak while it cooks. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
         center of a steak should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for rare.</li>
    <h4>Step Seven</h4>
    <li>Remove steak to a platter and allow to rest about 6 minutes before slicing. Cut in half lengthwise,
       then into 1/4-inch-thick slices at an angle against the grain. Drizzle with additional dressing.</li>
    </ol>
